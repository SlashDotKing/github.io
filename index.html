        <p id = "LearningCode">I learned coding first back in 1996. I used to make webpages and use the designed from Netscape Navigator amongst other tools, using frames and a whole bunch of other tools that are no longer viable.  I gave up coding in 2001, after dropping out of ECU and haven't coded since. I now am an IT Technician with Wayne County Public schools and repair devices <strong> many </strong> times a day. I am remembering so much about coding so actually it's been semi-stressful learning everything about coding and how it's changed over the years. Everything from shape building, to mouse interactivity, and website texts has been awesome. <br> I knew that I could do it, in theory, but never actually tried it until I had to use KhanAcademy in my class. <br> Boy was I wrong. <br> This hasn't just been "interesting". It's been epic and confusing and strange and awesome all together in one smoothie of feelings. <br>
            Basically KA is the best environment I could have asked for to learn these amazing programming techniques. Not only are the lessons clear and concise, but I can totally do whatever I want with these coding templates.

          <h2 class = "PostColor"> The Anime Food Conundrum </h2>
   <h6> April 11th, 2015.</h6>
   <p id = "FoodReview"> So, I rewatched one of the most profound anime about food, "Food Wars". My kids were watching it and telling me that it was the best food anime ever, I'm torn because I know where the idea for the whole anime came from... Yakitate Japan, now I'm going to tell you what I think about the differences.</p>

<p> I realize that TONS of people absolutely adore The Hobbit, but I couldn't stand it. It went way to slow for my taste, and even though the setting was really fascinating, the way the author described it was very boring in my opinion. Now let me clarify that I love tons of other books that are slower, and not upbeat dramas with action in it 24/7. I love tons of books that  have a more intricate plotlines, and exposes MANY details in the process. Like one of my favorite books of ALL TIME is Mistborn, by Brandon Sanderson (it's amazing, all you guys should check it out), is a VERY detailed story with an immensely complicated storyline. So for the record, I do like books that do have a slower plot.</p>
 <p> But see, The Hobbit was so slow that I just couldn't get into it. It started off with a very detailed description of the DOOR to the main character's (Bilbo Baggins) house. Not only was it really slow, but the writing style wasn't my thing. The author would frequently reference the BOOK ITSELF. For instance, somewhere in the book it says, actually during the story, "if you look at the beginning of the book, you'll find the maps". And this was very disorienting to me, as I would be reading, and then get interrupted by some first person instructions.</p>
 <p> Now I totally get that The Hobbit is extremely good writing, it's just not my type of book. For example, usually when a character dies in a book, I get really emotional. I miss them, I'm really upset if they go away. But in The Hobbit, some major characters died at the end, and I just didn't really care. Whereas everyone else seemed to be reall upset about it, I just didn't care.</p>
<p> People have told me that The Hobbit has deep, philosophical meaning, but I don't think it has much meaning if you have to purposely look for the meaning. Like the book DOES talk about some problems with the human nature like greed, but for the deeper meanings you have to like, look up on the Internet what they mean. So it sorta annoys me when people say "Oh it has a lot of complex themes!" because there's only deep meanings if you as the reader decide that there's meaning.</p>

<p> Anyway, that's my opinion. I really hated The Hobbit, and I think it's overrated. For those who do like it, I don't mean to insult you. I'm sure some people really enjoy that book (somehow). What is <em> your </em> opinion of The Hobbit? Tell me in the comments!</p>

 <h2 class = "PostColor"> Some of my favorite music now</h2>
 <h6> April 15th, 2015.</h6>

<p id = "FavMusic"> So we live in the 2000s, and these years have brought us so much new technology. Social websites, smart phones, the Internet, and so many things that are amazing and ingenous. But one of my favorite things, even though we've had it since the beginning, is music.</p>
<p> Now I love many different types of music, but my heart and soul is definitely pop. I love the infectious beats, the moving lyrics, and everything that just makes me want to belt out lyrics. So without further ado, here are some of my favorite songs or artists right now.</p>
  <ul>
      <li> Taylor Swift. I bought her album, <em> 1989 </em>, a few months ago. This has been the first album of hers I have ever bought, and I love it. The songs are all really catchy, and some of them I can relate to really well. </li>
      <li> Matt McAndrew. Not many people know of him, but he placed 2nd in the competition "The Voice". In my opinion he deserved 1st. But, you know, what can you do. Anyway, he released an original song during his time at "The Voice" called <em> Wasted Love </em> and it's one of my favorite songs lately, just because he starts off so soft and angelic, then he can get really strong and loud. So he has reallyg good range. If you haven't heard of him before, go check him out!</li>
      <li> <em> Riptide </em> by Vance Joy. The song is gaining popularity, and in my opinion, it deserves it. The song is so catchy and souful, you just can't help but start singing to it. The lyrics are very mystical and different, so it's not really obvious what you're singing about (which is actually sorta cool)</li>
       <li> <em> Shut Up and Dance </em>, by Walk the Moon. Okay, to be honest, I haven't bought the song, but when I hear it on the radio I love it. It has a REALLY good beat, and the lyrics I can connect to really well. It's all about not overthinking it, and just living in the moment. Which I think can be a really good message to a lot of us. </li>
    <li> <em> Little Lion Man </em>, by Mumford and Sons. Granted, this song is a few years old I think. But I absolutely ADORE the beat, and the vocals that go along are really good. It has a really strong guitar sound that makes it sound folk-y (which it sorta is).</li>
    <li> Kelly Clarkson. Now I know I'm sorta late to the bandwagon, but I'm starting to really like her music. I've been listening to a lot of her newest album, <em> Piece by Piece </em>, and her voice is just flat-out INCREDIBLE. One of my favorite songs on that album, <em> Invincible </em> is soooo strong in its vocals, and the message is really good in my opinion. It's all about how you can be broken down by society and its flaws, but you can always come back and be invincible. The beat is also pretty good, so I would suggest checking that track out.</li>
    <p> So there you go. Those are some of my favorite songs/artists lately. Granted I'm probably gonna think of something else IMMEDIATELY after this, but.....whatever. Tell me who your favorite-or least favorite-songs are! Do you really just despise some songs (trust me...I do. Maybe another article)? Tell me! I really adore hearing your opinions. </p>
  </ul>
